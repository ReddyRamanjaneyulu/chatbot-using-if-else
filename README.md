# 🤖 Chatbot Using If-Else

A simple rule-based chatbot built in Python using basic `if-elif-else` statements.  
This project demonstrates how natural language interaction can be simulated without any machine learning, using simple logic and input/output loops.

---

## 🧠 Objective

- Understand the basic structure of NLP systems
- Learn how rule-based systems process user input
- Practice with Python control flow and console I/O

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python 3 (no external libraries)
- Terminal / Command Prompt

---

## 💡 Features

- Responds to simple inputs like greetings and questions
- Exits on `bye`
- Uses a basic NLP flow: **Input → Preprocess → Match → Respond**
- No external dependencies or AI

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   git clone https://github.com/Reddyramanjaneyulu/chatbot-using-if-else.git
   cd chatbot-using-if-else


Run the chatbot:
python chatbot_nlp_basics.py




💬 Sample Interaction
You: hi
Chatbot: Hello!

You: how are you
Chatbot: I'm just code, but I'm doing fine!

You: bye
Chatbot: Bye! Have a nice day.
